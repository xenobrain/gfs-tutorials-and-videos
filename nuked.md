If you're willing to spend several hours dealing with C++ / gdnative, you could theoretically replicate godot 4 automatic LOD in godot 3.
The lib it uses is called meshoptimizer, someone made a GDNative port here https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/mesh_lod

Then you call it on the meshes you want at runtime but you have to deal with the LOD logic yourself, it's not going to work out of the box.
